Accurate estimation of the battery State of Charge (SOC) is crucial for optimizing the performance, safety, and lifespan of various battery-powered systems, including electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. However, SOC estimation is challenging due to measurement limitations, nonlinear battery dynamics, and operational complexities. This project presents a systematic comparison of conventional equivalent circuit model (ECM)-based methods (e.g., the extended Kalman filter) and modern sequence-to-sequence neural network methods, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Transformers, and Mamba models. We evaluate these approaches based on accuracy, computational complexity, and training requirements. We discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method, providing valuable insights for selecting and implementing various SOC estimation methods in practical applications.

The Mamba code is based on https://github.com/alxndrTL/mamba.py
