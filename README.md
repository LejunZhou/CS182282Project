Accurate estimation of the battery State of Charge
(SOC) and State of Health (SOH) is crucial for optimizing the
performance, safety, and lifespan of various battery-powered
systems, including electric vehicles and renewable energy storage
systems. However, SOC and SOH estimation are challenging
due to measurement limitations, nonlinear battery dynamics,
and operational complexities. This project presents a systematic
comparison of conventional equivalent circuit model (ECM)-
based methods (e.g., the extended Kalman filter) and modern
sequence-to-sequence neural network methods, including Re-
current Neural Networks (RNN), Transformers, and Mamba
models. The study provides valuable insights for selecting and
implementing various SOC and SOH estimation methods in
practical applications by comparing their accuracy, inference
time, and training complexity under realistic drive cycle data.
The Mamba code is based on https://github.com/alxndrTL/mamba.py
